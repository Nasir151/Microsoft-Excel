# LES Retail Store Chain - Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Analysis

## Overview

This project involves creating a series of reports to analyze and keep track of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for LES, a prominent retail store brand in the country. LES is the fourth largest supermarket chain, and it operates a significant number of supermarkets, hypermarkets, and provides online grocery retail services in select cities.

2. **City and State Data:** Information about the city and state where each transaction occurred.

3. **Product Category Data:** Details about product categories, which will be used to categorize sales.
