# Project 1: LES Retail Store Chain - Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Analysis

## Overview

This project involves creating a series of reports to analyze and keep track of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for LES, a prominent retail store brand in the country. LES is the fourth largest supermarket chain, and it operates a significant number of supermarkets, hypermarkets, and provides online grocery retail services in select cities.

## Data Requirements

Before we can create the reports, we need to gather and organize the necessary data. Since the provided amounts are blurred, we will calculate the KPIs based on available data.

### Data Sources:

1. **Product Sales Data:** We will need data on product sales, including product names, quantities sold, and revenue generated.

2. **City and State Data:** Information about the city and state where each transaction occurred.

3. **Product Category Data:** Details about product categories, which will be used to categorize sales.

## Report Details

### Report 1: Customers with Top Transactions

This report will identify and rank customers based on their transaction amounts. It will provide insights into the most valuable customers for LES.

### Report 2: Product Sales for a Period

This report will analyze product sales for a specified period. It will include information on the most sold products, revenue generated, and quantities sold.

### Report 3: ARPU for City and State

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) will be calculated for different cities and states. This will help understand revenue trends across different geographical regions.

### Report 4: Sales by Category with City Level Breakup

This report will break down sales by product category, providing insights into which categories are performing well in each city.

## Analysis Tools

To create these reports, we will use spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. These tools provide the flexibility to manipulate and visualize data effectively.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Gathering:** Collect and organize the required data from various sources.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensure data consistency and remove any errors or duplicates.

3. **Report Creation:** Develop the four reports, each focusing on a specific KPI.

4. **Data Analysis:** Calculate and visualize the KPIs in each report to provide meaningful insights.

5. **Presentation:** Present the reports in a clear and understandable format.

## Conclusion

By analyzing key performance indicators through these reports, LES can make informed decisions to improve its retail operations, customer engagement, and product offerings. This project will provide valuable insights into the retail chain's performance and help drive future strategies.
